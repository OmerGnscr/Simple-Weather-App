### Simple-Weather-App
This Python script is a simple weather app that retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user’s input. It takes the user’s OpenWeatherMap API key, city name, and units as inputs. The weather data is fetched from the API response, including the city name, temperature, weather description, “feels like” temperature, and wind speed.
This python code is created for my blog post about APIs
